## Node-RED

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a powerful tool for connecting various hardware and APIs. In addition, you can implement a local dashboard for Training Factory Industry 4.0 using MQTT nodes in Node-RED.

This example contains simple [Node-RED Flows](Node-RED/flows.json), which shows how the Training Factory Industry 4.0 can be connected to Node-RED.

You can import the example `flows.json` file in the Node-RED environment (see [HowTo](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export)).
